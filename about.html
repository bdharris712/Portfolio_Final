        <p class="aboutList">This page is under construction. In the meantime, you may download <a href="images/Brian Harris Resume - Mar 2022.pdf" style="cursor:pointer!important;"><u>my resume</u></a>.</p><br>
        <!-- <h2>5 Things You Would Never Think to Ask Me</h2>
            <p class="aboutList"><ol>As a "birder," I've been all over the world with my binoculars. I've seen and identified over 190 different species in the wild, including black-mandibled toucans and magnificent frigatebirds in Panama, black swans and purple marsh hens in New Zealand, ostriches and great egrets in Nigeria, vermillion flycatchers, Inca doves, and Zebra doves in Mexico, flamingos in Chile, great sapphirewing hummingbirds in Colombia, red-crowned parrots in California, and tundra swans and burrowing owls in Utah. My trip to Chile failed to find me a Humboldt's penguin so that's still on my bucket list.</p><br>
            <p class="aboutList">I have food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA), which means I am allergic to two of my favorite hobbies: baking and biking. I'm allergic to wheat, but the allergic reaction is only triggered by exercise. I can either eat the doughnuts or I can run off the calories&mdash;can't do both.</p><br>
            <p class="aboutList">I am an amateur aviculturalist, and have cared for four species of psittacines (parrots and parakeets). I also have several breeds of chickens, including Silkies, Americaunas, Wyandottes, and ISA Browns. Someday I would like to raise ducks, quail, pheasant, and chukar.</p><br>
            <p class="aboutList">I'm fluent in Spanish and use it regularly, but many people don't know that I also studied Latin, Japanese, and the Elvish langauge Quenya from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, as well as Palī, the language of the original Buddhist texts. I also enjoy obscure language puns, like,<blockquote>Q: What is the speed limit in Israel? <br>A: 五十五 (in Japanese, 55; pronounced 'go juu go')</blockquote></p><br>
            <p class="aboutList">My wife and I do our own landscaping, and we've cultivated an ecosystem that supports dozens of species of bees and hosts birds through the winter by providing both shelter and food. We have focused mostly on plants native to Utah and other drought-tolerant varieties for a stunning and sustainable landscape. I dug the river-bed by hand&mdash;it carries rain water into the yard, ending in a 64 cubic foot dry well, also hand dug.</ol></p> -->

      <div>
        <p>I'll also offer a few interesting facts about myself.<br>
        <ol>
          <li>I've been birding all over the world. I've seen and identified over 190 different species in the wild, including in Nigeria, various Latin American countries, and New Zealand.</li>
          <li>I'm allergic to two of my favorite hobbies, but only in combination. My wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis means I have to choose between baking and cycling.</li>
          <li>My family has had a lot of pets, including rabbits, chickens, parrots, hamsters, fish, crabs, frogs, and an adorable puppy.</li>
          <li>I'm fluent in Spanish, but I've also had training in Latin, Japanese, and Pali. Before discovering sociology, I was sure I wanted to be an archaeologist and interpret ancient texts. Perhaps I can explore a career in archaeology when I retire, or if my career is ever... wait for it... <i>in ruins</i>!</li>
          <li>My wife and I designed and built our entire landscape ourselves with mostly native plants, cultivating a thriving ecossytem that supports native bees and hummingbirds and provides food and shelter for overwintering birds.</li>
